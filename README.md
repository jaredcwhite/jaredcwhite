### A Hearty Hello from Portlandia! ðŸŒ²

Hi, I'm Jared! I build and contribute to open source Ruby software like [Bridgetown](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown) and [Ruby2JS](https://github.com/rubys/ruby2js).

[You can sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/jaredcwhite) right here on GitHub to help achieve my goal of introducing many more web developers to the delightful and productive Ruby language, and keeping Ruby a first-class citizen on the "Jamstack".

I also produce a podcast and blog on my site [JaredWhite.com](https://jaredwhite.com), and you can read my [Now page](https://jaredwhite.com/now) to find out what I'm currently focused on. (In case it's not obvious, my website is powered by Bridgetown. :sunglasses:)

Have any questions or requests for me? [Create an issue here](https://github.com/jaredcwhite/jaredcwhite/issues) and I'll respond shortly! :wave:

P.S. I'm available for consulting on all things Ruby, web components, and beyond. Contact me for further details. ðŸ¤™
